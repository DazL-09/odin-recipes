    <p>This Greek honey cake recipe yields a very moist cake, often found at Greek food festivals.</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup honey</li>
        <li>1 ¾ cups white sugar, divided</li>
        <li>¾ cup water</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon lemon juice</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated orange zest</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ cup unsalted butter</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup milk</li>
        <li>1 cup chopped walnuts</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine honey, 1 cup sugar, and water in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and<br>
            cook 5 minutes. Stir in lemon juice; bring to a boil and cook for 2 minutes.<br>
            Remove from heat and let cool while you prepare the cake.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9-inch
            <br>square baking pan.</li>
        <li>Combine flour, baking powder, orange zest, cinnamon, and salt in a bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat remaining 3/4 cup sugar and butter together in a large bowl until light<br>
            and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Beat in flour mixture, alternating with milk,<br>
            beating just until incorporated; stir in walnuts. Pour batter into the prepared pan.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into center comes out clean, about 40 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove cake from oven and poke holes over the surface with a toothpick.<br>
            Slowly ladle the cooled honey syrup over cake. For best results, set cake aside<br>
            for 4 to 6 hours to cool and absorb the syrup before slicing and serving.</li>
    </ol>
